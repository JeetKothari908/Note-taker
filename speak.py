x = 'From 1860 to 1950, America blossomed as an empire, and as such, received lots of immigration from other countries. However, not all immigrants were welcomed into America, as the American people saw some immigrants as racially inferior. Two examples of this are Chinese immigrants and Indian immigrants, but these two races’ stories differ in a lot of aspects. Chinese people had worse treatment from society, the government, and had more reason to immigrate than Indians. This is important because it helps explain how immigration systems around the world changed over time, as many countries adopted America’s exclusive form of immigration. The way that Chinese Americans were treated by society was worse than the way that Indian Americans were treated by society as it did more to hurt Chinese Americans. The way that Chinese Americans were treated by the government was worse than the way that Indian Americans were treated by the government as Chinese Americans had more unjust laws passed against them. Chinese people also had more reason to immigrate to America than Indian people did as China was in two different major wars, but India was facing poverty and droughts. The way that American society treated Chinese Americans was worse than the way that they treated Indian Americans because Chinese Americans were driven out of their communities, while Indian Americans were not. Examples of Chinese Americans being driven out of their communities, just in 1885 alone, are Eureka, Rock Springs, Bellingham, Tacoma, and Seattle. Indian Americans were only kicked out of their community once, in Bellingham, which had a history of driving any Asian people out of their community. Another way that Chinese Americans were treated worse than Indian Americans was through relationships with other races. Chinese Americans were disliked by other races, while Indian Americans were able to make communities with those other races. A prime example of this are the relationships between Mexicans and Chinese people, and Mexicans and Indian people. Mexican newspapers called Chinese Americans “savage”, “uncivilized”, and “lazy”,  and Mexican people cleared Chinese people out of Mexico. This resulted in Mexicans, some which migrated between Mexico and America seasonally, carrying their beliefs about Chinese people into America. This led to Chinese Americans being disliked by Mexican migrants. On the other hand, Indian Americans were able to make a vibrant community with Mexicans as Indian males, who migrated to the Mexico-America border in Southern California, began to seek out Mexican wives around World War 1. This led to an Indian-Mexican community forming. Even though Indian immigrants could manage to mingle with other races, unlike their Chinese counterparts, both ethnicities were still oppressed by the society. An example of this is how both races were portrayed by the media. A great example of this is cartoons. “Undesirable Citizens” (San Francisco Daily News, June 28, 1910) describes Indian Americans as vermin infested, poor, and disgusting people. “A Statue For Our Harbor” (George Fredrick Keller, The Wasp, November 11, 1881) describes Chinese Americans as filthy, immoral, and disease-ridden. While both groups were oppressed by white Americans, Chinese people were more oppressed as they were driven out of their communities and were disliked by other minorities. Another way that white Americans oppressed both parties is through the government.Chinese Americans were treated worse by the government than Indian Americans as Chinese people had more federal punishing laws directed at them, while Indian Americans did not. Two examples of this are the Scott Act and the Foreign-Miners’ License Laws. The Scott Act forbade Chinese Americans from returning to America if they went to China, which nullified 20,000 Chinese Americans’ return tickets, making them not able to return to America. The Foreign-Miners’ License Laws “forced every Chinese miner, during a period of twenty years, to pay $4 to $20 per month for the privilege of working claims which others had abandoned.” This was oppressive as it took weath away from Chinese miners for working claims that weren’t as good as the ones that white Americans were working. While Chinese Americans had laws specifically directed against them, Indians had a more informal form of oppression. America used informal oppression against Indians by using vague reasons to reject Indian immigrants from becoming American citizens. Using this method, only 45% of Indians were allowed into America. To put this in perspective, 91% of Chinese people were allowed to become American citizens. While Indians weren’t able to become Americans as much as Chinese people, Indian Americans were still treated better than Chinese Americans. This was partly caused by India being a British colony, which meant that Britian wanted their citizens to not face blatant discrimination, and America didn’t want to push one of their closest allies away.  In the face of all of these forms of oppression, Indian and Chinese people still wanted to come to America. One might wonder why, and the reasons for that are the benefits of moving to America. The benefits of moving to America were greater for Chinese people than Indian people as Chinese people were escaping the Second Opium War and the Chinese Civil War, while Indians were facing milder issues. Chinese citizens were facing 2 different wars during this time period—the Second Opium War (1856-1860) and the Chinese Civil War (1929-1947). The Second Opium War led to expanded Western influence in China, weakening of the Chinese dynasty system, and decreased economic stability. These problems, along with the Chinese Civil War, which took over 20 million lives, led Chinese people to want to leave China. While Chinese people were fleeing from wars, Indian people faced economic dislocation, high taxes, and farming losses, all of which helped destroy many family farms. While Indian people and Chinese people faced different push factors from their home countries, they had similar pull factors towards America— the land of opportunity. The promise of wages almost 10 times higher than wages in China or India led to both parties wanting to immigrate to America. This meant that the main goal of immigrating was to make money, and due to gender norms, young men were mostly sent from both groups. While Chinese and Indian peoples’ pull factors towards America were almost identical, their push factors were incredibly different. This was partly due to Britain sending 400,000 indentured servants from India to British colonies in Africa, which led to a mass migration out of India. This led to a labor shortage, which led to the push factors that Indian people had to face.While Chinese Americans faced greater hardships from American society and government, they also had more reason to immigrate to America than Indian Americans. Chinese Americans were generally disliked by other races, were driven out of their communities, and had oppressive laws passed against them. However, Chinese people im\migrated to America because they were fleeing multiple wars in China. While both Indian and Chinese people were oppressed by white Americans in the post-reconstruction era, this would soon stop as the Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed in 1943, and with it, a large number of discriminatory laws. Indian Americans situation got better as they got independence from Britain in 1947. As these things happened, America began a new era— an era devoid of racism and discrimination.'
